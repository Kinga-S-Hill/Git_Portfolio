# Welcome to my Git portfolio
This repositosy is a collection of R Markdown files that I used to build spatial analytics projects.

## Project Files (in alphabetica order)

### Joyplots.Rmd
This notebook is a fun mapping art project where I use the boundary of a state to download elevation ratsred and then convert those to lines for a fun looking final artsy map.

### US_Cities_Flexdashbaord
i built a shiny/flexdashboard to interactively explore the largest cities in each US State.
