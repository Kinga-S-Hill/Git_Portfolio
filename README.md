# Welcome to my Git portfolio
This repository is a collection of R Markdown files that I use to build spatial analytics projects.

## Project Files (in alphabetical order)

### Joyplots.Rmd
This notebook is a fun mapping art project where I use the boundary of a state to download elevation rasters and then convert those to lines for an artsy map.

### US_Cities_Flexdashbaord
I built a shiny/flexdashboard to interactively explore the largest cities in each US State.
